**The Word for World is Forest**
Invitation Open House 2024 at HGK Basel
Friday, January 19th, 2024, 12h –21h

The students and staff of the BA Process Design at HyperWerk and the MA Experimental Design from the Institute Experimental Design and Media Cultures (IXDM) are showing what they are up to at this year's Open House at HGK.

With "The word for world is forest" we invite you to ask ourselves: How can we live together if we imagine the world as a forest? Students and staff will provide insights into colorful, moving, sounding and fragrant encounters. On January the 19th 2024, you are invited to try out sustainable, equitable and digital forms of living together with the designers of the future.

Please join us and look forward to a variety of perspectives and an exciting program.

The visuals for the communication were compiled and designed by Anouk Tosca, Felix von Zimmermann, Nils Niederhauser, Noah Müller and Salome Rickenbacher, accompanied by Ivana Jović.
